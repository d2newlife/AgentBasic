Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. They are found in most of the world's freshwater habitats, as well as in the sea, and one family, the terrestrial tortoises, are found in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. There are about 360 living species of turtles. Turtles have a very long lifespan, with some individuals living over 100 years. They play important roles in marine and freshwater ecosystems, such as controlling jellyfish populations and maintaining seagrass beds. However, many species are currently endangered due to habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.

Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, for the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. They are a crucial part of our ecosystem, with over 20,000 known species worldwide. Bees are primarily vegetarians, feeding on nectar and pollen. Pollen provides protein and lipids, while nectar provides carbohydrates for energy. Bees are essential for the reproduction of many plants, including a large number of the crops humans rely on for food. Their populations are facing threats from habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change, making conservation efforts increasingly important.

Turtles are reptiles belonging to the order Testudines, characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs and acting as a shield. They are found in a variety of habitats, including oceans, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. There are over 300 species of turtles, varying greatly in size, appearance, and lifestyle. Some well-known examples include the sea turtle, snapping turtle, and tortoise. Turtles are known for their long lifespans, with some species living over 100 years. They are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. Their diet varies by species, ranging from herbivores to carnivores and omnivores. Turtles play important roles in their ecosystems, such as seed dispersal and nutrient cycling.
